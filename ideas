Methods can return new objects that are not of the same class as the object you called the method on.  Sometimes these objects will behave like other objects your familiar with (like arrays!) and trick you. You can always ask an object what class it is and you can always ask it what methods it responds to (reflection).

When we scrape websites, we use gems to parse HTML. (nokogiri)

We also use gems to make it easier to communicate with web servers using the HTTP protocol.(httparty, faraday, typhoeus, rest-client)  We could implement this protocol ourselves but that would be such a pain.  Someone has already created a gem/library which knows how to communicate using the HTTP protocol and has created a nice descriptive API for us to use.  We are both using the API of the gem, and potentially interacting with a web service's API.

We send out HTTP get requests (typically) when we do web scraping.  We could do the same thing in a browser when we type a URL into the address bar of Chrome.  The browser gets a giant string of HTML back, parses it, and renders it in the browser.  But we only want to parse the HTML, we don't want to render it!
